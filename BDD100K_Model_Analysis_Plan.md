## 📊 Analysis Framework Overview

### Phase 1: Quantitative Metrics Framework
**Duration**: 2 days  
**Deliverable**: Comprehensive performance metrics across all classes and conditions

#### Core Metrics Suite
```python
# Standard Detection Metrics
- mAP@0.5, mAP@0.5:0.95, mAP@0.75
- Per-class Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Average Precision

# BDD100K-Specific Metrics  
- Size-stratified mAP (small/medium/large objects)
- Safety-critical group performance (VRU classes)
- Environmental condition performance (weather/lighting)

# Production Metrics
- Inference speed, Memory usage, Model size
- Confidence calibration, Detection stability
```

#### Why These Metrics?
- **mAP@0.5:0.95**: Industry standard, captures both detection and localization quality
- **Size-stratified mAP**: Critical for BDD100K's 1000x object size variation
- **Safety-critical mAP**: Weighted metric for vulnerable road user detection
- **Environmental metrics**: Autonomous vehicles must work in all conditions

### Phase 2: Qualitative Visualization Framework  
**Duration**: 3 days  
**Deliverable**: Interactive visualization tools and failure case galleries

```

### Phase 3: Failure Case Analysis & Clustering
**Duration**: 2 days  
**Deliverable**: Systematic failure taxonomy and clustering analysis

#### Failure Classification System
```python
# Failure Types
- False Negatives: Occlusion, small objects, lighting, motion blur
- False Positives: Phantom objects, background confusion, duplicates  
- Localization Errors: Poor bbox fitting, partial detection

# Clustering Methodology
- Computer vision-based similarity clustering (SIFT/ORB)
- Environmental condition clustering (weather/time/scene)
- Object characteristic clustering (size/position/occlusion)
```

### Phase 4: Performance Pattern Detection
**Duration**: 2 days  
**Deliverable**: Systematic pattern analysis with actionable insights

#### Pattern Analysis Areas
```python
# Spatial Patterns

- Horizon line analysis (above/below horizon performance)
- Object position clustering and bias detection

# Environmental Patterns  
- Weather condition impact (clear/rain/snow/fog)
- Lighting condition sensitivity (day/night/dawn/dusk)
- Scene type performance (highway/city/residential)

# Object Interaction Patterns
- Multi-object scenario performance
- Co-occurrence relationship analysis
- Context-dependent detection patterns
```

### Phase 5: Comprehensive Reporting
