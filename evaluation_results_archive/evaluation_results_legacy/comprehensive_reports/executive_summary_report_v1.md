- **Cost:** Very High ($400K+ including safety validation and redesign)

### 3. Fundamental Architecture Issues
- **Impact:** High - Current architecture appears unsuitable for task
- **Timeline:** 3-6 months - Complete architecture research needed
- **Cost:** High ($200K+ in research and development)

### 4. Training Process Failure
- **Impact:** Critical - Training process has not produced viable model
- **Timeline:** Immediate - Training methodology must be completely revised
- **Cost:** High ($150K+ including data pipeline and training infrastructure)

## Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (0-1 months)

## Resource Requirements

| Resource Category | Requirement | Justification |
|-------------------|-------------|---------------|
| Engineering Effort | 12-18 person-months | Complete redevelopment required |
| Data Collection/Annotation | Extensive | Current data pipeline may be compromised |
| Compute Resources | Very High | Architecture research and extensive training |
| Timeline to Production | 9-12 months | Fundamental improvements required |
| Risk Mitigation Budget | $500K+ | Complete project overhaul needed |

## Executive Conclusion

**RECOMMENDATION: COMPLETE PROJECT REASSESSMENT**

The current model demonstrates no viable object detection capability, indicating fundamental issues in either the training process, data pipeline, or architectural choice. This level of performance failure suggests that continuing with incremental improvements would not be cost-effective.

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Immediate halt** of current development approach
2. **Complete failure analysis** to identify root causes
3. **Architecture reassessment** with proven alternatives
4. **Budget reallocation** for comprehensive redevelopment
5. **Timeline extension** of 9-12 months for viable solution

**Business Risk:** Current model poses unacceptable safety risks and cannot be considered for any production deployment. Alternative solutions or fundamental project redesign required.
