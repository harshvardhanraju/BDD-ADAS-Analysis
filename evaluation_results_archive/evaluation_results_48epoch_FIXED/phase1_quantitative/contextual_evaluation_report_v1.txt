CONTEXTUAL ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------
Environmental Robustness: The model demonstrates consistent performance across 
different environmental conditions, indicating robust feature extraction 
capabilities despite overall low performance levels.

Object Size Sensitivity: Performance varies significantly by object size, with 
medium-sized objects showing relatively better detection rates. This suggests 
potential improvements through multi-scale training approaches.

Spatial Bias: Strong positional bias observed, with middle-left regions showing 
best performance. This pattern may indicate learned spatial shortcuts rather 
than robust object detection capabilities.

IMPROVEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------------------------
1. Small object detection needs improvement - consider multi-scale training
2. Strong position bias detected - model may be learning shortcuts
3. Implement data augmentation strategies to reduce spatial bias
4. Consider focal loss for addressing object size imbalance
5. Evaluate alternative backbone architectures for better multi-scale features

TECHNICAL INSIGHTS
--------------------------------------------------
- Environmental consistency suggests robust preprocessing pipeline
- Size-dependent performance indicates architecture limitations
- Spatial bias requires attention in training data distribution
- Overall low F1 scores necessitate fundamental model improvements
