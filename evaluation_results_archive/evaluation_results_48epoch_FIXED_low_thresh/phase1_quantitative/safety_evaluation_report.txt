⚠️  SAFETY RISK ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------
CRITICAL ISSUES:
  ❌ pedestrian: Extremely high false negative rate (99.82%) - UNSAFE
  ❌ pedestrian: Very low precision (16.90%) - excessive false alarms
  ❌ rider: Extremely high false negative rate (100.00%) - UNSAFE
  ❌ rider: Very low precision (0.00%) - excessive false alarms
  ❌ bicycle: Extremely high false negative rate (98.01%) - UNSAFE
  ❌ motorcycle: Extremely high false negative rate (100.00%) - UNSAFE
  ❌ motorcycle: Very low precision (0.00%) - excessive false alarms

HIGH RISK CLASSES:
  🚨 pedestrian: High miss rate - safety critical
  🚨 rider: High miss rate - safety critical
  🚨 bicycle: High miss rate - safety critical
  🚨 motorcycle: High miss rate - safety critical

  • pedestrian: Recall (0.18%) < 80.0%
  • rider: FNR (100.00%) > 10.0%
  • rider: Precision (0.00%) < 70.0%
  • rider: Recall (0.00%) < 80.0%
  • bicycle: FNR (98.01%) > 10.0%
  • bicycle: Precision (31.75%) < 70.0%
  • bicycle: Recall (1.99%) < 80.0%
  • motorcycle: FNR (100.00%) > 10.0%
  • motorcycle: Precision (0.00%) < 70.0%
  • motorcycle: Recall (0.00%) < 80.0%

🛠️  IMPROVEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------------------------
1. URGENT: Improve pedestrian recall - consider increasing class weights, adding hard negative mining, or collecting more training data
2. Improve pedestrian detection sensitivity - lower confidence thresholds or enhance training data with difficult examples
3. Reduce pedestrian false alarms - improve data quality or add negative examples to training data
4. URGENT: Improve rider recall - consider increasing class weights, adding hard negative mining, or collecting more training data
5. Improve rider detection sensitivity - lower confidence thresholds or enhance training data with difficult examples
6. Reduce rider false alarms - improve data quality or add negative examples to training data
7. URGENT: Improve bicycle recall - consider increasing class weights, adding hard negative mining, or collecting more training data
8. Improve bicycle detection sensitivity - lower confidence thresholds or enhance training data with difficult examples
9. Reduce bicycle false alarms - improve data quality or add negative examples to training data
10. URGENT: Improve motorcycle recall - consider increasing class weights, adding hard negative mining, or collecting more training data
11. Improve motorcycle detection sensitivity - lower confidence thresholds or enhance training data with difficult examples
12. Reduce motorcycle false alarms - improve data quality or add negative examples to training data
