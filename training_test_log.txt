INFO:timm.models._builder:Loading pretrained weights from Hugging Face hub (timm/resnet50.a1_in1k)
INFO:timm.models._hub:[timm/resnet50.a1_in1k] Safe alternative available for 'pytorch_model.bin' (as 'model.safetensors'). Loading weights using safetensors.
INFO:timm.models._builder:Missing keys (fc.weight, fc.bias) discovered while loading pretrained weights. This is expected if model is being adapted.
Some weights of DetrForObjectDetection were not initialized from the model checkpoint at facebook/detr-resnet-50 and are newly initialized because the shapes did not match:
- class_labels_classifier.bias: found shape torch.Size([92]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([11]) in the model instantiated
- class_labels_classifier.weight: found shape torch.Size([92, 256]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([11, 256]) in the model instantiated
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
