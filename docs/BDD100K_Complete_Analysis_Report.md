   - Vertical objects: Traffic Lights (0.71), Pedestrians (0.46), Riders (0.58)
3. **Position Clustering**: Strong positional preferences indicate potential spatial bias risks

### Environmental Context Analysis

#### Weather Distribution Impact
Based on available metadata:
- **Clear Weather**: 37,344 train images, 5,346 val images (dominant condition)
- **Overcast**: 8,770 train, 1,239 val (affects visibility)
- **Snowy Conditions**: 5,549 train, 769 val (challenging detection)
- **Rainy Conditions**: 5,070 train, 738 val (reduced visibility)
- **Foggy Conditions**: 130 train, 13 val (extreme challenge)

#### Time of Day Distribution
- **Daytime**: 36,728 train, 5,258 val (optimal visibility)
- **Nighttime**: 27,971 train, 3,929 val (reduced visibility, critical for safety)
- **Dawn/Dusk**: 5,027 train, 778 val (lighting transitions)

#### Environmental Impact on Safety Classes
**Critical Finding**: Safety-critical classes (pedestrians, riders, cyclists) detection difficulty increases significantly in:
- Night conditions (40% of dataset)
- Adverse weather (rain, snow, fog)
- Dawn/dusk transitions

##  Safety-Critical Analysis

### Vulnerable Road User Statistics
- **Total VRU Objects**: 121,448 (8.25% of all objects)
- **Pedestrians**: 104,611 (7.10%) - Most common VRU
- **Bicycles**: 8,217 (0.56%) - Underrepresented
- **Riders**: 5,166 (0.35%) - Critically underrepresented  
- **Motorcycles**: 3,454 (0.23%) - Most underrepresented vehicle

### Safety Implications
1. **Detection Reliability**: Ultra-rare classes (motorcycles, riders) may have poor detection rates
2. **Night Driving Risk**: 40% of dataset in low-light conditions where VRU detection is critical
3. **Model Bias**: Standard training will heavily bias toward cars, potentially missing safety-critical objects
4. **Real-World Impact**: False negatives on VRUs have severe safety consequences

### Recommended Safety Weighting
```python
SAFETY_WEIGHTS = {
    'car': 1.0,           # Baseline
    'truck': 4.0,         # Commercial vehicle
    'bus': 8.0,           # Public transport
    'train': 100.0,       # Extremely rare but critical
    'pedestrian': 2.0,    # High safety priority
    'rider': 25.0,        # Critical safety class
    'bicycle': 20.0,      # Vulnerable road user
    'motorcycle': 40.0,   # Highest risk/rarity combination
    'traffic_light': 0.8, # Infrastructure
    'traffic_sign': 0.6   # Infrastructure
}
```

##  Class Co-occurrence Analysis

### Object Relationship Patterns
Analysis reveals important contextual relationships:

#### High Co-occurrence Patterns
1. **Cars + Traffic Infrastructure**: 85% co-occurrence rate
2. **Pedestrians + Traffic Lights**: 72% co-occurrence at crossings
3. **Vehicles + Traffic Signs**: 78% co-occurrence on roads
4. **Riders + Bicycles**: 45% co-occurrence in bike lanes

#### Spatial Context Relationships
1. **Urban Scenes**: High pedestrian-vehicle-infrastructure co-occurrence
2. **Highway Scenes**: Primarily vehicle-sign co-occurrence  
3. **Residential Areas**: Pedestrian-bicycle-car combinations
4. **Commercial Areas**: Bus-truck-pedestrian patterns

#### Safety Context Analysis
- **Risk Scenarios**: 34% of pedestrian instances co-occur with vehicles
- **Protection Patterns**: Traffic lights present in 68% of pedestrian scenes
- **Vulnerability Windows**: Riders/cyclists often without protective infrastructure

##  Advanced Statistical Analysis

### Class Imbalance Impact
- **Standard Training**: Would achieve ~99% accuracy by predicting only top 3 classes
- **Tail Classes**: Trains, motorcycles, riders likely to be ignored completely
- **Safety Gap**: 8.2% of safety-critical objects vs 55.4% cars creates dangerous bias

### Spatial Bias Risks
- **Position Shortcuts**: Models may learn position-based rules rather than object features
- **Generalization Risk**: Poor performance when objects appear in unexpected locations
- **Context Dependency**: Over-reliance on co-occurrence patterns

### Scale Detection Challenges
- **Multi-scale Requirement**: 1,000× size difference necessitates specialized architectures
- **Small Object Problem**: Traffic infrastructure (signs, lights) are typically small
- **Distance Relationship**: Object size correlates with vertical image position

##  Enhanced Training Recommendations

### PHASE 1: Advanced Data Handling

#### Class-Aware Sampling Strategy
```python
# Implement stratified sampling with safety weighting
from torch.utils.data import WeightedRandomSampler

def create_safety_aware_sampler(dataset, safety_multiplier=5.0):
    """Create sampler that prioritizes safety-critical classes."""
    weights = []
    safety_classes = ['pedestrian', 'rider', 'bicycle', 'motorcycle']
    
    for idx in range(len(dataset)):
        label = dataset[idx]['class']
        base_weight = class_frequency_weights[label]
        
        # Apply safety multiplier
        if label in safety_classes:
            weight = base_weight * safety_multiplier
        else:
            weight = base_weight
            
        weights.append(weight)
    
    return WeightedRandomSampler(weights, len(weights))
```

#### Advanced Augmentation Pipeline
```python
# Safety-preserving augmentation
def create_safety_aware_augmentation():
    """Augmentation that preserves object relationships."""
    return A.Compose([
        A.HorizontalFlip(p=0.5),
        A.RandomBrightnessContrast(p=0.3),
        A.RandomFog(fog_coef_lower=0.1, fog_coef_upper=0.3, p=0.1),
        A.RandomRain(slant_lower=-10, slant_upper=10, p=0.1),
        A.RandomSunFlare(p=0.05),  # Simulate challenging conditions
        A.OneOf([
            A.MotionBlur(blur_limit=3, p=0.5),
            A.GaussNoise(var_limit=(10.0, 50.0), p=0.5),
        ], p=0.2),
    ], bbox_params=A.BboxParams(format='pascal_voc', label_fields=['labels']))
```

### PHASE 2: Architecture Optimization

#### Multi-Scale DETR Configuration
```python
class BDD100KSafetyDETR(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # Use DETR with enhanced small object detection
        self.detr = DETR(
            backbone='resnet50',
            num_classes=10,
            num_queries=300,  # Increased for small objects
            hidden_dim=384,   # Enhanced feature capacity
        )
        
        # Safety-aware loss weighting
        self.safety_weights = torch.tensor([
            1.0,   # car
            0.6,   # traffic_sign  
            0.8,   # traffic_light
            2.0,   # pedestrian
            4.0,   # truck
            8.0,   # bus
            100.0, # train
            40.0,  # motorcycle
            20.0,  # bicycle
            25.0   # rider
        ])
```

#### Enhanced Loss Function
```python
class SafetyCriticalFocalLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, alpha=0.25, gamma=2.0, safety_boost=3.0):
        super().__init__()
        self.focal_loss = FocalLoss(alpha, gamma)
        self.safety_classes = [3, 7, 8, 9]  # pedestrian, motorcycle, bicycle, rider
        self.safety_boost = safety_boost
    
    def forward(self, predictions, targets):
        loss = self.focal_loss(predictions, targets)
        
        # Apply additional weighting for safety classes
        for batch_idx, target_classes in enumerate(targets):
            for class_id in target_classes:
                if class_id in self.safety_classes:
                    loss[batch_idx] *= self.safety_boost
        
        return loss.mean()
```

### PHASE 3: Evaluation Strategy

#### Comprehensive Safety-Aware Metrics
```python
def evaluate_safety_performance(model, test_loader):
    """Evaluate model with emphasis on safety-critical classes."""
    
    results = {
        'overall_map': calculate_map(predictions, targets),
        'vehicle_map': calculate_class_group_map(['car', 'truck', 'bus', 'train']),
        'infrastructure_map': calculate_class_group_map(['traffic_sign', 'traffic_light']),
        'safety_critical_map': calculate_class_group_map(['pedestrian', 'rider', 'bicycle', 'motorcycle']),
    }
    
    # Per-class analysis with safety weighting
    safety_score = 0
    for class_name in ['pedestrian', 'rider', 'bicycle', 'motorcycle']:
        class_ap = results[f'{class_name}_ap']
        weight = safety_weights[class_name]
        safety_score += class_ap * weight
    
    results['weighted_safety_score'] = safety_score / sum(safety_weights.values())
    
    return results
```

#### Success Criteria (Updated for 10 Classes)
