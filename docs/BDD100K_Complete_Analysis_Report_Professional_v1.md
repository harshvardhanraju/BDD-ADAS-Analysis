## Conclusion

The BDD100K 10-class dataset presents significant challenges due to extreme class imbalance and multi-scale object detection requirements. Success requires sophisticated training strategies, architecture choices optimized for the specific challenges, and particular attention to safety-critical object performance.

The current model performance (near-zero mAP) indicates fundamental issues requiring complete reassessment of training methodology, architecture selection, and evaluation protocols. A systematic approach addressing class imbalance, multi-scale detection, and safety-critical optimization is essential for viable autonomous driving applications.
