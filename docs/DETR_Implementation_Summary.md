# DETR Implementation Summary for BDD100K Object Detection

## Executive Summary

This document summarizes the complete implementation of a DETR (Detection Transformer) model for object detection on the BDD100K autonomous driving dataset. The implementation includes data analysis, model selection, training pipeline, and evaluation framework.

## üìä Project Overview

### Dataset Analysis Findings
Based on  comprehensive BDD100K dataset analysis, we identified key characteristics that influenced our model selection:

- **Severe Class Imbalance**: 60.2% cars, 20.2% traffic signs, 15.7% traffic lights
- **Rare Classes**: train (0.05%), rider (0.2%), bus (1.1%), truck (2.5%)  
- **Spatial Patterns**: Cars in bottom-center, signs on roadsides, lights overhead
- **Size Variation**: Objects ranging from 0.87 to 917,000+ pixels¬≤
- **Multi-scale Challenge**: Need to detect tiny signs and large vehicles

### Model Selection Rationale

Selected **DETR (Detection Transformer)** based on:

1. **Set-based Prediction**: Eliminates NMS issues in dense driving scenes
2. **Global Context Understanding**: Self-attention captures spatial relationships
3. **Multi-scale Handling**: Natural handling of size variation without anchors
4. **Class Imbalance Resilience**: Flexible loss function integration
5. **End-to-end Training**: Simplified pipeline without post-processing

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### 1. Model Architecture

```python
# DETR Configuration for BDD100K
- Backbone: ResNet-50 (pretrained)
- Hidden Dimension: 256
- Number of Queries: 100
- Encoder Layers: 6
- Decoder Layers: 6
- Attention Heads: 8
```

### 2. Key Features Implemented

#### Class Imbalance Handling
- **Focal Loss**: Œ±=0.25, Œ≥=2.0 for hard example mining
- **Class Weights**: Inverse frequency weighting


#### Data Processing Pipeline
- **Image Preprocessing**: Resize to 416*416, normalization
- **Bbox Normalization**: Center format [cx, cy, w, h] in [0, 1] range
- **Data Augmentation**: Horizontal flip, brightness/contrast, Gaussian noise

#### Training Pipeline
- **Optimizer**: AdamW with different learning rates for backbone (1e-5) and head (1e-4)
- **Scheduler**: Step LR with Œ≥=0.1 every 7 epochs
- **Gradient Clipping**: Max norm of 0.1 to prevent exploding gradients

### 3. Evaluation Framework

#### mAP Computation
- **IoU Thresholds**: 0.5 to 0.95 (standard COCO evaluation)
- **Confidence Threshold**: 0.1 (configurable)
- **Per-class AP**: Individual class performance tracking



#### 2. Advanced Techniques
- **Curriculum Learning**: Start with easier examples
- **Multi-scale Training**: Random image scales [480, 800]
- **Longer Training**: 50+ epochs with proper validation
- **Class Balancing**: Weighted sampling during training
