  - Best/worst performing examples per class
  - Class-specific failure modes
  - Inter-class confusion analysis
  - Rare class special analysis

- [ ] **Spatial Bias Analysis**
  - Where in image each class is detected
  - Compare with expected spatial patterns
  - Identify spatial biases and blind spots

- [ ] **Size and Scale Analysis**
  - Performance vs object size
  - Multi-scale detection capability
  - Scale-dependent error patterns



Advanced Approaches for Qualitative Analysis:
Identify most critical failure modes of the model and then use that for further analysis:
1. Calculate Visual embeddings of failure images by BLIP2 and then dimensional reduction(UMAP, t-SNE, PCA) adn then clustering(DBSCAN)
  - uncover hidden structure
  - Uncovering patterns in incorrect/spurious predictions
  - Mining hard examples for your evaluation pipeline
  - Recommending classes that need additional training data
  - Unsupervised pre-annotation of training data


2. Cluster all the failure images by thier metadata to see patterns - 
  - Weather, time of day, scene, Occlusion/Truncated objects
  a. can tell customer that small size cars(far off) are failing in rainy weather, at night in clear roads. Possible soltuions- More data generation, 
  b. can have scene classification modes for CRITICAL cases which are very important - for eg: rainy weather and fog needs to be supported - so
    develop a fogg or rain classifier(Yes or No, 2 classes) and if the images fall in this category, pass them through a SVM or more focused model for classification(2 stage pipeline)

3. Postprocessing can be applied to recheck the predictions: Can apply heuristics (size, aspect ratio, template matching)
   on low confidence/probability predictions to  double check - to avoid False Positives(F.P)

4. Focus on Safety-critial scenarios/analysis 
  - Focus on rider detection and vehicle detection failures

5. Interpretability - GradCAM++, attention analysis,
