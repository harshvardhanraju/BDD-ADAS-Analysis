The model requires significant improvements before production consideration. Current
performance levels present unacceptable risks for autonomous vehicle deployment,
particularly in safety-critical scenarios.

Recommend comprehensive 6+ month development effort focusing on architecture improvements,
safety-focused training, and extensive validation. Consider alternative approaches or
significant additional investment in model development.\n\n================================================================================\nThis report represents a comprehensive analysis of the BDD100K object detection model\nacross performance, safety, robustness, and business readiness dimensions.\nGenerated by automated evaluation framework on 2025-08-27 11:59:40\n================================================================================
