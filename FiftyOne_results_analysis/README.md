2. **Safety-Critical Focus**: Apply class-weighted loss functions  
3. **Hard Example Mining**: Use similarity search for difficult cases
4. **Multi-Scale Training**: Handle objects at different scales
5. **Interactive Analysis**: Use FiftyOne App for detailed exploration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**FiftyOne Not Installed**
```bash
pip install fiftyone
```

**Missing Annotations File**
- Ensure `data/analysis/processed_10class_corrected/val_annotations_10class.csv` exists
- Run your data preprocessing pipeline if needed

**Model Checkpoint Not Found**
- Verify checkpoint path in `checkpoints/complete_10class_demo/checkpoint_epoch_048.pth`
- Ensure your trained model is available

**Memory Issues**
- Reduce subset size: `--subset 100`
- Close other applications
- Monitor memory usage during analysis

### Performance Optimization
- Start with small subsets (10-20 images) for testing
- Use `--no-app` to skip launching the interactive app
- Run analysis incrementally for large datasets

## Interactive Exploration

After running analysis, explore results interactively:

```bash
# Launch FiftyOne App with your dataset
python3 -c "import fiftyone as fo; dataset = fo.load_dataset('bdd100k_real_analysis'); fo.launch_app(dataset)"

# Or run the main script to launch app automatically
python3 FiftyOne_results_analysis/scripts/real_analysis_with_blip2.py --subset 20
```

## Integration with Your Workflow

### Model Improvement Pipeline
1. Run FiftyOne Brain analysis to identify failure patterns
2. Implement recommended improvements (FPN, class weighting, etc.)
3. Retrain model with targeted enhancements
4. Re-run analysis to measure improvement
5. Iterate until performance goals are met

### Production Deployment
