Based on analysis of 100 validation images

## Executive Summary

**Overall Performance**: Precision 0.030, Recall 0.131
**Key Challenge**: Low Precision
**Primary Recommendation**: Reduce False Positives

## Priority Actions

### HIGH PRIORITY: Reduce False Positives
**Recommended Methods:**
- Increase confidence threshold
- Apply stricter NMS
- Hard negative mining

### HIGH PRIORITY: Improve Object Detection
**Recommended Methods:**
- Collect more data
- Increase model capacity
- Class rebalancing

### MEDIUM PRIORITY: Address Class Imbalance
**Recommended Methods:**
- Focal loss tuning
- Class-specific augmentation
- Balanced sampling

## Data Collection & Quality

- Collect more training data for underperforming classes: car, truck, bus, rider, traffic_sign, traffic_light
- Apply class-specific data augmentation for rare classes: car, truck, bus, rider, traffic_sign, traffic_light
- Consider synthetic data generation for extremely rare classes (train, rider)
- Review spatial distribution for classes with unexpected patterns: traffic_sign

## Model Architecture

- Consider increasing model capacity or using larger backbone (ResNet-101, ResNeXt)
- Implement focal loss with higher gamma to focus on hard examples
- Add feature pyramid networks (FPN) for multi-scale detection
- Increase number of object queries in DETR decoder
- Implement auxiliary losses for intermediate decoder layers
- Consider ensemble methods with multiple detection heads

## Training Strategy

- Implement stronger class rebalancing for: bus, train, rider
- Use curriculum learning starting with balanced mini-batches
- Apply progressive resizing with class-aware sampling

## Deployment Considerations

- Consider post-processing filters to improve precision for deployment
- Model may miss critical objects - not suitable for safety-critical applications without improvement
